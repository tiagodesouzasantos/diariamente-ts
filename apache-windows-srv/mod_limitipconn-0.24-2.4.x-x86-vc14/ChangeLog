* Version 0.24 - 2012/04/25
- Patch by Jan Kaluza <jkaluza@redhat.com> and Joe Orton
  <jorton@redhat.com> to fix compilation with httpd-2.4
  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=809730)

* Version 0.23 - 2008/03/02
- Changed the licensing terms to the Apache 2.0 License
- Added a new quick handler routine, which runs before mod_cache.
- Per-server directives are now supported, and handled by the quick handler.
  Per-directory directives are handled as before by the normal handler.
- When running as a quick handler we don't go through the entire lookup
  phase (resolve path, stat file, etc) before we get the possibility
  to block a request. This gives a clear performance enhancement.
- Don't do subrequest to lookup MIME type if we don't have mime-type
  specific config.
- Count connections in closing and logging state too; we don't want to
  be DOS'd by clients behind buggy firewalls and so on.
- Added debug messages for easy debugging.
- Reduced loglevel from ERR to INFO for reject-logging.
- Removed proxy tracking feature, which is obsoleted by mod_extract_forwarded
